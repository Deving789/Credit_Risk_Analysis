# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 

Credit risk is very tough to predict. In this project we want to take a look at how all the factors in our loan_stats csv help predict whether someone is low or high risk status. One method that data scientists use for this type of issue is creating a model and then evaluate and train the models that they create. In this specific project we are using imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build models and evalute them using a resampling method.

Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
