# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 

Credit risk is very tough to predict. In this project we want to take a look at how all the factors in our loan_stats csv help predict whether someone is low or high risk status. One method that data scientists use for this type of issue is creating a model and then evaluate and train the models that they create. In this specific project we are using imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build models and evalute them using a resampling method. In the first couple of models I oversampled the data using randomoversampler and smote algorithms and undersample the data with the clustercentroid algorithm. In the remaining models I used a combination approach to over and undersample the data using smoteenn. Finally, I compared two machine learning models that minimize bias, balancedrandomforestclassifier and easyensembleclassifier.

## Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

## Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
